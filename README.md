I am a big fan of Domain Driven Design, Design patterns (both GOF and PoEAA) and Principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY), and ASP.Net MVC. In my career I am not fortunate to have any mentor. Therefore, I always read technical books to enrich my technical knowledge. Among all those books, one book has a huge influence in this project which is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-Design-Patterns-Millett/dp/0470292784> Professional ASP.Net Design Pattern</a> of <a href=https://uk.linkedin.com/in/scottmillett> Scott Millett</a>. This project is inspired by the project of Scott Millett “Agatha’s Storefront”. This project is differed in use of ORM. I used Code First Entity Framework ORM whereas Agathas used NHibernet. I have written some blogs by inspiring his famous books <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-Design-Patterns-Millett/dp/0470292784>Professional ASP.Net Design Patterns</a> and <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Principles-Practices-Domain-Driven-Design/dp/1118714709>  Practicing Domain Driven Design</a>. I prefer to write down my notes in my blogs to remember and share with others. During creating Repository and Unit of Work I followed <a href=http://weblogs.asp.net/shijuvarghese/developing-web-apps-using-asp-net-mvc-3-razor-and-ef-code-first-part-1> Shiju Varghese's</a> <a href=https://github.com/shijuvar/EFMVC.Azure> EFMVC</a>. I would like to give special thanks to brother, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/ashraful.alam?fref=ts> Ashraf Alam Joy</a>. He is my big inspiration. As well as, I would like to give special thanks to <a href=https://www.facebook.com/m.arifulhoque?fref=ts>Md. Ariful Hoque</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mdkaiserahmed?fref=ts">Kaiser Ahmed</a>, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/rubol?fref=ts>Rubol Chowdhury</a>, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/rashedul.islam.18?fref=ts>Rashedul Islam</a>,<a href=https://www.facebook.com/rabbiul?fref=ts> Rabbiul Islam</a>, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/kuntolbd?fref=ts>Kuntal Biswas</a>, <a href=https://www.facebook.com/shuvo.sarker.5817?fref=ts>Shuvo Sarkar</a> for supporting me mentally to continue this project. If this project and my written blogs would help anyone in any ways then it would be a great achievement for me.
